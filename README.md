A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the characteristics (also called attributes or properties) and behaviors (also known as methods or actions) that the objects will have.

Think of it like an architect’s blueprint for a house. The blueprint itself is not a house, but it defines what a house should look like and what features it should have, such as doors, windows, and rooms.

For example, if we have a class called Car, it might define properties like brand, color, and speed and behaviors like accelerate and brake. However, at this stage, it’s just an idea—no actual car exists yet.

An object is an actual instance of a class. It is the real-world representation of the blueprint that can store data and perform actions.

Continuing with the house analogy, if a class is the blueprint, then an object is a house that has been built from that blueprint. You can have multiple houses built using the same blueprint, but each house can have different details—one might be blue, another red, and another with a garden.

In Java, if Car is the class, then a Tesla Model 3 or a Ford Mustang would be objects of that class, each with its own brand, color, and speed values.

Key Conceptual Differences

What it is	 ------- Class ------- A blueprint or template	 ------- Object -------                         A real-world instance of the class

Exists in memory? ------- Class ------- 	        No, it's just a definition	------- Object -------                    Yes, it occupies memory when created

Can store data?	 ------- Class -------  No, it only defines structure------- Object -------	                Yes, objects hold actual values

Can perform actions? ------- Class -------  No, it only describes behavior	------- Object -------                Yes, methods can be executed on objects

Example ------- Class ------- Car (describes attributes like brand, color, and speed) ------- Object -------        A Tesla Model 3 or a Ford Mustang (specific real-world examples)
